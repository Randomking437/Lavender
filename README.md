Lavender is a Discord.JS-based bot that allows 3 things: easy moderation, boat-loads of fun, and lightweight self-deployment.

Features to Come:
> See [Issues](https://github.com/KnoxDevTeam/Lavender/issues)

# Building
Building Lavender is super simple. Open a terminal with Node.JS and NPM installed and simply do:
```
npm install
```
Afterwards, take the config.ex.json and edit it to your likings. You will need to make a Discord bot using the Discord Developer panel and put the token in the config file. After that, simply run the following command and you're good to go:
```
npm start
```
